This is the README file to the Analytics Project.

## 1. Installation
   - Certify you have Python and pip installed
   - Install streamlit (https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation)
   - Download the trained models, as well as the model used for our Streamlit App from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X1-MAklKmDKqpv0g7XFada9KCId6hz-z?usp=share_link
   - Navigate to the 'app' folder inside the newly downloaded folder
   - Open a terminal inside this folder
   - Execute streamlit-app (streamlit run app.py)

## 2. Models
   To try any past version/model of our Entity CLassification Project, please refer to https://github.com/Chenjinlin28/Analytics-Project/tree/87ae372bd4b7bcf5400b444f9481f0f149ccf3d7/Database%20Part . In there, you can find individual folders with one or more versions of each model, simply download the model you would like to see and run it.  
- Distilbert: 2 models
- Setfit: 6 mofels
- Neural Network: 1 model
Do not forget to:
   - Install streamlit (https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation)
   - Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Chenjinlin28/Analytics-Project.git) OR download it via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X1-MAklKmDKqpv0g7XFada9KCId6hz-z?usp=share_link .
  
## 3. Project
   Our Entity Classification Project aims to create a model of text classification that is able to categorize and identify entities (words) inside scientific articles, whilst understanding the context in which they are being used. Our project aims to improve text-data classification.


## 4. Trained Models and Streamlit App
Trained models are too large to push to GitHub, therefore please find the trained models, as well as the model used for our Streamlit App, attached.
